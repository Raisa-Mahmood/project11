    <h3>Learn about headphones</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="col-lg-15">Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are
        electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user
        listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby
        to hear. Headphones are also known as earphones or, colloquially, cans. Circumaural (around the ear) and
        supra-aural (over the ear) headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the drivers in place. Another type,
        known as earbuds or earpieces, consists of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are
        bone conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving
        the ear canal open. In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of a headphone and microphone.</div>
